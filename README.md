## Setup
- Make sure you have a Github account.
- Login to Github.
- Login to repl.it, using "sign in with github"
- Click on the assignment link sent through canvas and accept the assignment. 
- Click on your personal github repository for the assignment.
- Login in Repls https://replit.com/repls and then create a new replit by importing from github repository.
- You'll work with a partner to complete this recitation. You will be able to code together in the same `repl.it` instance. You can choose whose repl.it instance you will share. This person will click the "Share" button in their repl.it instance and email the lab partner.
- Make sure the dependencies are installed. Please use 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

## Running and testing your code
- You can modify and add any functions or statements in `main.py`, then test it using `test_main.py`. Please make sure `test_main.py` includes `from main import *`.
- To run tests, from the command-line shell, you can run
  + `pytest test_main.py` will run all test functions.
  + `pytest test_main.py::test_one` will just run `test_one` function.
  + We recommend running one test at a time as you are debugging.

## Turning in your work

- Once complete, click on the "Git" icon in the left pane on repl.it.
- Enter a commit message in the "what did you change?" text box
- Click "commit and push." This will push your code to your github repository.
- Although you are working as a team, please have each team member submit the same code to their repository. One person can copy the code to their repl.it and submit it from there.
